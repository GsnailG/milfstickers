            have been done

            </ul>
        </p>

    <div class="blurb">
        <h2>how?</h2>

        <p> so i got some photoshop (thx school) and made some funny
            designs, i then use my printer to print them out on some 
            cool sticker paper, then i realize i've ran out of ink, so 
            i cry, and get more ink, then the printer has a jam, so i cry 
            and then fix the jam and then WHAT THE I JUST PUT INK IN 
            YOU YOUR NOT EMPTY!!!! <br> anyways after that i put them 
            in an envelope and send them off.
        </p>

    </div>

    <div class="blurb">
        <h2>where?</h2>

        <p> thats a stupid question, so instead ill ask on behalf of you, "how do these get delivered to you?" <br>
            what a wondeful question, so to answer that, ive made a wee table to help you see
        </p>
        
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>location</th>
                <th>method</th>
                <th>price</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>mountain view highschool</td>
                <td>walking to your location</td>
                <td>free</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>timaru</td>
                <td>my bike, the will to knock on your door</td>
                <td>2$</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>new zealand</td>
                <td>an envelope</td>
                <td>idk</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>international</td>
                <td>an envelope, but with more stamps</td>
